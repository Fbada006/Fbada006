Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ferdinand Bada. I am the Lead Android Engineeer at a startup called [Huduma Fasta](http://hudumafasta.co.ke/) in Mombasa, Kenya. I am also a Google Certified Associate Android Engineer. I started out learning at home through the Grow With Google program for Africa and I have not looked back since then with my love for Android Development and software in general.

I have been working on Android for several years and I enjoy building beautiful apps with Kotlin. I am proficient in Java as well as Flutter (for hybrid apps). I am a former learner of Udacity and currently I am adding GCP to my portfolio with course materials from Pluralsight. 

Follow my blog [here](https://effbada.hashnode.dev/) to stay updated with my articles on software development with a focus on android.
