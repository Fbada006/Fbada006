Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ferdinand Bada. I am the Lead Android Engineeer at a startup called [Huduma Fasta](http://hudumafasta.co.ke/) in Mombasa, Kenya. I am also a Google Certified Associate Android Engineer.

I have been working on Android for the past 2 years or so and I enjoy building beautiful apps with Kotlin. I am proficient in Java as well as Flutter (for hybrid apps). I am a former learner of Udacity and currently I am adding GCP to my portfolio with course materials from Pluralsight.
