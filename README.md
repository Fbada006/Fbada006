Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ferdinand Bada.

I am the Lead Android Engineer at [Proto Energy](https://protoenergy.com/) in Nairobi, Kenya. I am also a Google Certified Associate Android Engineer. I started out learning at home through the Grow With Google program for Africa and I have not looked back since then with my love for Android Development and software in general.

I have been working on Android for several years and I enjoy building beautiful apps with Kotlin. I am proficient in Java as well as Flutter (for hybrid apps). I am a former learner of Udacity and currently I am adding GCP to my portfolio with course materials from Pluralsight. 

Additionally, I love mentoring and speaking in tech events. See my speaker timeline [here](https://timelines.gitkraken.com/timeline/4b768261dc98495388858a4307b81af0?range=2019-05-07_2021-02-28).
